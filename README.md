## Introduction

Socket programming is a fundamental concept in networking that allows communication between processes across a network. This repository explores how to create client-server applications, handle connections, send and receive data, and more using sockets in C.

## Getting Started

1. **Compile the Code**:
   ```
   gcc server.c -o server
   gcc client.c -o client
   ```

2. **Run the Server**:
   ```
   ./server
   ```

3. **Run the Client**:
   ```
   ./client
   ```

## Concepts

- Basic TCP and UDP client-server communication
- Handling multiple client connections
- Sending and receiving files over sockets
- Implementing a simple chat application
